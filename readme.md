# Triangulate Processing

A processing application, which uses pre-computed triangulated and original versions of an image then masking them together with alpha layer to effect triangulation on the image upon user input.

If you are using android mode, due to blending problems and low framerate on android, use <code>is_android = true</code>.

For desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) use <code>is_android</false> and draw/paint on the screen as you do in paint :)
